    <p><h2><em>Air Fryer Roasted Carrots</em></h2></p>
    <p>There's nothing quite as good as roasted carrots. The delicate sweetness combined with the perfect seasoning creates nothing short of vegitable candy. 
        Yet this candy is actually healthy!The biggest issue with making them, as well as any roasted vegitable, is the mess created with a roasting pan and the 
    time it takes to do the actual roasting (usually 30+ minutes at 400F.</p> 
    <p>Our cheat code for these roasted carrots is an air fryer. This amazing device makes it dead simple to do almost anything to do with food and the cleanup is a snap. The convection
        properties of the air fryer makes quick work of anything cooked in it, and will take quite a bit less than the usual 30+ minutes a traditional stove would take.
