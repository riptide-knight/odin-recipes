    <h2><em>Beef Tacos</em></h2> 
    <p>Beef tacos are a staple dish in many American homes. Their simplicity coupled with their fast cook time and delicious flavor is sure to 
        please even the pickiest of eaters (except for my son).</p> 
    <p>We will be making our beef tacos with good 80/20 ground beef because fat is where it's at. Also, do waste time making your own seasoning 
        as Ole Elpaso has done a pretty bang up job already.</p>
