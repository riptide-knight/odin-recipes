    <p><h2><em>Beef Tacos</em></h2></p>
    <p>Beef tacos are a staple dish in many American homes. Their simplicity coupled with their fast cook time and delicious flavor is sure to 
        please even the pickiest of eaters (except for my son).</p> 
    <p>We will be making our beef tacos with good 80/20 ground beef because fat is where it's at. Also, do waste time making your own seasoning 
        as Ole Elpaso has done a pretty bang up job already.</p>  

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground Beef 1lb</li>
            <li>Taco Seasoning Pack</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Chili Powder 1tsp (I like to add a little Extra)</li>
            <li>Corn Tortillas</li>
            <li>Your Favorite Taco Extras</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    </p>    
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium skillet, brown meat until it is cooked through and has gained a slightly brown color. None of this gray meat nonsense.</li>
            <li>Once the meat is done, follow the instructions on the packet of taco seasoning, adding the salt, pepper, and chili powder.</li>
            <li>Stick the tortillas in the microwave for 15 seconds to warm them up (double points for warming them in a skillet).</li>
            <li>Plate your tacos the way you like and eat! (Note: this can be done on any day of the week, not just Tuesday).</li>
        </ol>
